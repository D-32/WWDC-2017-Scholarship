My Swift playground realizes the idea of visualizing all the people I met since I entered the Apple community. It's a interactive 3D world where each sphere represents the name and country of birth of a friend I made at a conference, meetup or during my work experience. It's my way of remembering each moment I spent in this amazing community, which has helped me to grow as a person and programmer. This is my contribution to thank everyone I met so far. 

## Usage
This Playground was made in a few hours using SceneKit and AppKit. Feel free to give it a try and explore the world! ðŸŒŽ

## Technologies
The Playground targets macOS and uses SceneKit and AppKit. The images were generated in a separate playground using the `UIGRaphicsRnderer` class to create images starting from the JSON file.
